# ofxEquiMapRender

This addon renders equirectangular projections.  It's based on:

* **ofxEquiMap:** (https://github.com/hanasaan/ofxEquiMap) by Yuya Hanai.  See also the forum discussion: http://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/equirectangular-projection-shader/19937
* **ofxCubeMap:** (https://github.com/andreasmuller/ofxCubeMap) by Andreas Muller (Note: This is *not* the same `ofxCubeMap` included in the oF GL library).

I created this addon to avoid confusion with the older libraries and the built-in `ofxCubeMap` distributed with OpenFrameworks.  It integrates code from those projects and adds new features compatible with OpenFrameworks 0.12 and later.

This addon provides a simple and efficient way to render equirectangular images in your OpenFrameworks projects.  Refer to the example code for usage instructions.
